# HOT Connect

![ezgif-26d74832f88c3c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4422057-38bb-4cd9-8bd0-568e29f46280)

Zero-dependenices, robust, secure and lightweight wallet connector for the NEAR blockchain with **easily updatable** wallets code

`yarn add @hot-labs/near-connect`

## How it works

Unlike near-wallet-selector, this library provides a secure execution environment for integrating wallets. This eliminates the need for a single registry of code for all wallets.

## Available wallets in manifest

- HOT Wallet
- Meteor Wallet
- MyNearWallet
- Nightly Wallet
- Near Mobile Wallet
- Unity Wallet
- any wallet via WalletConnect

## Dapp integration

```ts
import { NearConnector } from "@hot-labs/near-connect";

const connector = new NearConnector({
  network: "mainnet",
  // Optional for wallet-connect wallets
  walletConnect: {
    projectId: "",
    metadata: {},
  },
});

connector.on("wallet:signOut", async () => {});
connector.on("wallet:signIn", async (t) => {
  const wallet = await connector.wallet(); // api like near-wallet-selector
  const address = t.accounts[0].accountId;
  wallet.signMessage(); // all methods like near-wallet-selector
});
```

## Wallet integration

The developer writes a self-hosted script that implements the integration of their wallet and adds a description to the common [manifest](./repository/manifest.json):

```json
{
  "id": "hot-wallet",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "HOT Wallet",
  "description": "Secure Multichain wallet. Manage assets, refuel gas, and mine $HOT on any device with HOT Wallet",
  "icon": "https://app.hot-labs.org/images/hot/hot-icon.png",
  "website": "https://hot-labs.org/wallet",

  "executor": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hot-dao/near-selector/refs/heads/main/repository/hotwallet.js",
  "type": "sandbox",

  "platform": {
    "android": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.herewallet.hot&hl=en",
    "ios": "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hot-wallet/id6740916148",
    "chrome": "https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hot-wallet/mpeengabcnhhjjgleiodimegnkpcenbk",
    "firefox": "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hot-wallet",
    "tga": "https://t.me/hot_wallet"
  },

  "features": {
    "signMessage": true,
    "signTransaction": true,
    "signAndSendTransaction": true,
    "signAndSendTransactions": true,
    "signInWithoutAddKey": true,
    "verifyOwner": false,
    "testnet": false
  },

  "permissions": {
    "storage": true,
    "allowsOpen": [
      "https://hot-labs.org",
      "https://t.me/hot_wallet",
      "https://play.google.com",
      "https://apps.apple.com",
      "hotwallet://"
    ]
  }
}
```

The `executor` endpoint called in a standalone iframe if the user decides to use this wallet on the site. The script implements the [NearWallet](./src/types/wallet.ts) wallet class and registers it in a special object
`window.selector.ready(yourNearWallet)`

After that, the library delegates user requests directly to `yourNearWallet` via `iframe.postMessage` communication.
In addition, the script has the ability to draw any UI in the area allocated for the iframe that is necessary for interaction with the wallet.

## Sandbox limitations

For security, the wallet script runs in a sandboxed iframe, which has many limitations. It cannot call modals or access an external page or use localStorage.
The `window.selector` implements some features for this:

```ts
interface NearSelector {
  location: string; // initial dapp location href
  ready: (wallet: any) => void; // must call executor script for register wallet
  open: (url: string, newTab = false) => void; // used for my-near-wallet

  // use instead of localStorage
  storage: {
    set: (key: string, value: string) => Promise<void>;
    get: (key: string) => Promise<string>;
    remove: (key: string) => Promise<void>;
    keys: () => Promise<string[]>;
  };
}
```

## Manifest permissions

- `{ "storage": true }`: Use window.selector.storage in execution script
- `{ "allowsOpen": ["https://wallet.app"] }` Use window.selector.open for `allow` domains
- `{ "location": true }`: Use window.selector.location for initial url from dapp
- `{ "walletConnect": true }`: Use window.selector.walletConnect for use client

## Manifest features

Each wallet must specify in the manifest a list of features that are supported.
This will help dApps filter wallets by the required features. As soon as the wallet starts supporting the required feature -- it simply adds it to the manifest and updates its execution script, all dapps automatically download the updates without the need to update the frontend.

```ts
const selector = new NearConnector({
  // Show wallets that support signMessage and testnet env
  features: { signMessage: true, testnet: true },
});
```

## How to add my wallet?

When you develop a connector for your wallet, you can immediately test your code on real applications that use HOT Connect. Super easy!
Once you have written your executor script and tested it - you only need to send a PR to update repository/manifest.json. After review, your wallet will automatically become available to all dApps that use the HOT Connector.

## Injected wallets

Like [Ethereum Multi Injected Provider Standart](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) this library supports injected wallets for extenstions and in-app browsers. Your injection script can dispatch custom event with your wallet:

```js
class NearWallet {
  manifest: { ... };
  signIn() {}
  // all implementation
}

window.addEventListener("near-selector-ready", () => {
  window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("near-wallet-injected", { detail: new NearWallet() }));
});
```

## Background and future audit scope

Maintaining the current near-wallet-selector takes a lot of time and effort, wallet developers wait a long time to get an update to their connector inside a monolithic code base. After which they can wait months for applications to integrate their wallet into their site or update their frontend to update the wallet connector. This requires a lot of work on the review side of the near-wallet-selector team and STILL does not ensure the security of internal packages that will be installed in applications (for example, RHEA Finance or Near Intents).
All these problems prompted us to write a new solution that will:

1. safely and isolatedly execute the code for connecting to wallets
2. quickly and conveniently update wallets on all sites
3. Save the internal near-wallet-selector team from endlessly maintaining a huge code base, because now only the wallet itself is responsible for the connection of each wallet and hosts its script wherever it wants.

The auditor does not need to look for vulnerabilities in the connection code of each wallet, this is the responsibility of the wallet team and their own audits.
The selector audit should be aimed at investigating the risks of interaction with the isolated code that is launched at the moment of connection to the wallet. The auditor should assess the reliability of the permissions that are described in the manifest and API for interaction of the isolated code with the host.
In fact, main target for audit is `src/wallets/near-wallets/SandboxedWallet/*`.

Additional:
Auditing `src/helpers` will help assess the correctness of the coding algorithms.
Auditing `src/popups` will help assess the correctness of interaction with the DOM, the presence of potential XSS attacks.

## Multichain Connector (WIP)

HotConnector is an add-on for aggregating different connectors for different blockchains. The purpose of aggregation is to provide a single interface for working with NEAR Intents, implementing message signing standards for different types of blockchains and wallets.
You can use only NearConnector. This library functionality is optional for use.

```ts
const multichainConnector = new HotConnector({
  chains: [WalletType.NEAR, WalletType.EVM, WalletType.SOLANA, WalletType.TON],

  onConnect: async (wallet) => {
    const address = await wallet.getAddress();
    setWallets((t) => ({ ...t, [wallet.type]: address }));
  },

  onDisconnect: (type) => {
    setWallets({ ...wallets, [type]: null });
  },

  // NearConnector from @hot-labs/connector // NearConnector from @hot-labs/connector
  nearConnector: new NearConnector({
    manifest: manifest as any,
    network: "mainnet",
    logger: console,
  }),

  // ton-connect, IMPORTANT: Declarate <div id="ton-connect" style="display: none"></div> in root of your app
  tonConnect: new TonConnectUI({ connector: new TonConnect(), buttonRootId: "ton-connect" }),

  // reown for evm and solana
  appKit: createAppKit({
    adapters: [new EthersAdapter(), new SolanaAdapter()],
    networks: [mainnet, solana, base, bsc],
    projectId: "4e23423b97d8d587e69801d",
    metadata: {
      name: "HOT Connector demo",
      description: "HOT Connector demo",
      url: "https://hotconnector.demo.hotlabs.io",
      icons: ["https://hotconnector.demo.hotlabs.io/favicon-beige.ico"],
    },
  }),
});

// Call any wallet for intents.near protocol
multichainConnector.executeIntents(WalletType.EVM, [
  { intent: "transfer", tokens: { "nep141:wrap.near": "10000" }, receiver: "address" },
]);
```
